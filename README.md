## My solutions to the Advent of Code 2025 programming challenges
I decided to try and write these in C, a programming language I was unfamiliar with at the start of this challenge and am currently in the process of learning. 
I therefore strongly recommend any even mildly seasoned C programmers to NOT look at this code, it is probably as bad as it is straightforward.
Additionally, these solutions aren't optimized in the slightest, they are just solutions.

I did, however, have a lot of fun tackling these problems and coming to grips with C as a language and thus a huge thanks to the developers behind Advent of Code!
